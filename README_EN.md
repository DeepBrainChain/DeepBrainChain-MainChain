# How to join DBC network

If you have some DBC and want to get more, you can choose to **become a `validator`**, which requires 7\*24 hours to run a node. If you don't want to run a node, but still want to get profit, you can choose to be a **nominator by nominate `validators`**.

+ `Validator`: A validator needs to maintain a full node, which is mainly responsible for verifying transactions and generating blocks based on consensus. 
+ `Nominator (Nominator)`: A nominator needs to stake `DBC` and nominate the `validator`, by this way it is possible to generate the `validator` in the network and share the rewards with the `validator`. DBC will be slash when the validator is punished.

## Introduction

#### Periods of common actions and attributes in DBC network

  + Slot：30 seconds **(generally one block per slot)**
  + Epoch duration：4 hour
  + Era duration：24 hours (6 sessions per Era, one Era is an election peroid, and is also a reward calculation peroid)
  + The `n-1` Era election period (the election period interval is 1 Era) will generate a new set of Validators, responsible for `n+1` Era block generation 

#### Total reward amount：

+ In [0～3) year: 10^9 DBC every year
+ In [3~8) year: 0.5 * 10^9 DBC every year
+ In [8, 8+) year：0.5 * (2.5 * 10^9 + DBC_from_renter) / 5 DBC every year

#### Reward rules：

+ After each block is generated, the rewards obtained by the block producer will be recorded to the `ErasRewardPoints`, and the rules for reward `EraRewardPoints` are: 

  + 20 points for main chain block producers
  + 2 points for uncle block producers
  + 1 point for producers who quoted uncle blocks
+ The validators get same amount of rewards for the same job 
+ **Reward retention time**: **84 era (84 days)**, rewards exceeding the retention time will not be recorded. Anyone can send `Payout` transactions to get rewards (even if they do not participate in the stake), and everyone who staked in the validator node can get rewards by a single call.
+ **Validator Reward** = Total Reward * Customized Commissions + Remaining Part of Reward * Percentage of validator staked
+ **Nominator Award**: **Only the top 128 of stakes can be rewarded ( according to the stake amount).** `Number of rewards = (total rewards of nodes - custom commissions of validators) * Percentage of nominator's stake`
